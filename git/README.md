# Git

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system
with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear
workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux
kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version
control system for software development.

NewsCred uses Git as version control system for all software projects. All NewsCred
git repositories are hosted in Github.

# Git Workflows

Being a very flexible tool, Git allows various different styles of development
workflows.

Atlassian's [Git Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows) tutorial
does a great job of explaining the commonly use workflows. At NewsCred, we use both
[Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-feature-branch)
and [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-forking),
depending on the project.

Find out what workflow your project uses in the respective project wiki.
